Revision history for Posy-Plugin-TextToHTML
===========================================

0.62 Thu 12 May 2005
--------------------

  * (12 May 2005) update Posy version

  * (12 May 2005) add Makefile.PL

0.6101 Sun 20 March 2005
------------------------

  * (20 Mar 2005) fix parsing of txt2html_options
  	Before, one wasn't able to give empty options, as they were treated
  as an option containing '' rather than as the empty string.

0.61 Sun 06 February 2005
-------------------------

  * (6 Feb 2005) added INSTALL docs

  * (5 Feb 2005) fix to txt2html_parent default

0.60 Fri 04 February 2005
-------------------------

  * (4 Feb 2005) raw non-processing
  	Changed txt2html_on to txt2hmtl_parent (with reversed sense
  and more explicit documentation as to what is going on).
  	Added txt2html_raw_flavour to save time when one is displaying
  plain text files as plain text; eg you have a 'txt' flavour and you
  want to display the raw text rather than converting it to HTML.
  One could do this before by using $entry_raw, but it still generated
  the HTML anyway.  This enables one to disable the processing on a
  per-flavour basis.

0.50 Thu 03 February 2005
-------------------------

  * (3 Feb 2005) removed Makefile.PL

  * (3 Feb 2005) make this processing optional
  	Added a config option 'txt2html_on' which is by default true,
  but can be set to false if the user doesn't want to use this plugin
  to process this file at this time.  Useful for 'chrono' or 'category'
  displays where one is only displaying a short body anyway.

0.40 Sat 15 January 2005
------------------------

  * (15 Jan 2005) splitting out from Posy core
