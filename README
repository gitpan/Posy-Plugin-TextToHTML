==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::TextToHTML - Posy plugin to convert plain text files to HTML


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::TextToHTML.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This uses the HTML::TextToHTML module (as used by the txt2html script) to
convert the body of an entry from text into HTML. This checks the extension
of the entry file, and if it is 'txt', then it will convert the entry.

This basically replaces the 'parse_entry' method, and calls the parent
method for anything other than text.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the data
directory.

``txt2html_options''
Set the options for the text-to-HTML processing. See HTML::TextToHTML for
details. Certain options are meaningless in this context and will be
ignored, since this is not being processed as a full file, but as just body
content. Therefore options such as 'append_file', 'prepend_file' and
'append_head' will not work, as well as options which refer to doing things
to the headers. But that's okay, since you can do things like that with
flavours and other plugins.

Give the options as one long space-separated string, with each option name
followed by its value. For example:

txt2html_options: xhtml 1 escape_HTML_chars 0 make_anchors 0
